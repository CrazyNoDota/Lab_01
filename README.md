# ReadMe

This program is written in Java and contains several functions to demonstrate recursion. Each function implements a recursive algorithm to accomplish its task.
Functions

    findAverage function:

    This function takes an array of integers as input and recursively calculates the average of the elements in the array. It returns the calculated average.

    findMin function:

    This function takes an array of integers as input and recursively finds the minimum element in the array. It returns the minimum element.

    isPrime function:

    This function takes an integer as input and recursively determines whether the number is prime or composite. It returns true if the number is prime and false if it is composite.

    factorial function:

    This function takes an integer as input and recursively calculates the factorial of that number. It returns the calculated factorial.

    fibonacci function:

    This function takes an integer as input and recursively calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term. It returns the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

    power function:

    This function takes two integers as input and recursively calculates a raised to the power of n. It returns the calculated result.

    printArrayInReverse function:

    This function takes an integer as input and recursively prints the input integers in reverse order.

# Usage

The main function is used to test the above functions by calling each function with appropriate arguments.

To test a particular function, simply comment out the other function calls in the main function and uncomment the function call of the desired function. Then, run the program to see the result of the function call.

Note: Some of the functions are not listed in the main section. Write your own implementation to use them.
